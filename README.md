# Corda Training Solutions

This repo contains all the solutions for the practical exercises of the Corda two-day training course.

This repository is divided into two parts: Java Solutions, and Kotlin Solutions.

# Setup

### Tools
* JDK 1.8 latest version
* IntelliJ latest version (2017.1 or newer)
* git

After installing the required tools, clone or download a zip of this repository, and place it in your desired
location.

### IntelliJ setup
* From the main menu, click `open` (not `import`!) then navigate to where you placed this repository.
* Click `File->Project Structure`, and set the `Project SDK` to be the JDK you downloaded (by clicking `new` and
nagivating to where the JDK was installed). Click `Okay`.
* Next, click `import` on the `Import Gradle Project` popup, leaving all options as they are.
* If you do not see the popup: Navigate back to `Project Structure->Modules`, clicking the `+ -> Import` button,
navigate to and select the repository folder, select `Gradle` from the next menu, and finally click `Okay`,
again leaving all options as they are.

# Instructions
This project follows a test-based development style - the unit tests for each class contain all the information needed to complete this CorDapp.

These are the solutions for the training material. The tests are uncommented and ready to be run. If you have configured everything correctly, all
tests should pass without having to change any of the solutions code.

### Running the tests
* Kotlin: Select `Kotlin - Unit tests` from the dropdown run configuration menu, and click the green play button.
* Java: Select `Java - Unit tests` from the dropdown run configuration menu, and click the green play button.
* Individual tests can be run by clicking the green arrow in the line number column next to each test.
* When running flow tests you must add the following to your run / debug configuration in the VM options field. This enables us to use
* Quasar - a library that provides high-performance, lightweight threads.
* "-javaagent: /PATH_TO_FILE_FROM_ROOT_DIR/quasar.jar"

# Running the CorDapp
Once your application passes all tests in `IOUStateTests`, `IOUIssueTests`, and `IOUIssueFlowTests`, you can run the application and
interact with it via a web browser. To run the finished application, you have two choices for each language: from the terminal, and from IntelliJ.

### Kotlin
* Terminal: Navigate to the root project folder and run `./gradlew kotlin-source:deployNodes`, followed by
`./kotlin-source/build/node/runnodes`
* IntelliJ: With the project open, select `Kotlin - Node driver` from the dropdown run configuration menu, and click
the green play button.

### Java
* Terminal: Navigate to the root project folder and run `./gradlew java-source:deployNodes`, followed by
`./java-source/build/node/runnodes`
* IntelliJ: With the project open, select `Java - NodeDriver` from the dropdown run configuration menu, and click
the green play button.

### Interacting with the CorDapp
Once all the three nodes have started up (look for `Webserver started up in XXX sec` in the terminal or IntelliJ ), you can interact
with the app via a web browser.
* From a Node Driver configuration, look for `Starting webserver on address localhost:100XX` for the addresses.

* From the terminal: Node A: `localhost:10009`, Node B: `localhost:10012`, Node C: `localhost:10015`.

To access the front-end gui for each node, navigate to `localhost:XXXX/web/iou/`

## Troubleshooting:
When running the flow tests, if you get a Quasar instrumention error then add:

```-ea -javaagent:lib/quasar.jar```

to the VM args property in the default run configuration for JUnit in IntelliJ.
